This is making Excel Services to become the default view solution for Excel files. However, this is a farm-wide setting (you don't have too much flexibility there) and that means Excel Web App will never be used for view mode. Activate this feature in order to change this behavior and redirect any Excel Services request to Excel Web App (part of Office Web Apps)." featureId="851e5539-f0c7-462a-a3c9-5f46b93e8d15" imageUrl="" receiverAssembly="$SharePoint.Project.AssemblyFullName$" receiverClass="$SharePoint.Type.23d91ccd-7e4a-4464-9f20-efc3ab15d274.FullName$" scope="WebApplication" solutionId="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" title="Excel Web App Redirecter" version="" deploymentPath="$SharePoint.Project.FileNameWithoutExtension$_$SharePoint.Feature.FileNameWithoutExtension$" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2008/SharePointTools/FeatureModel" />
